The Secondary and Senior Secondary Wing Library is located on the sixth floor. Library services are provided by professionally trained librarians as well as by trained volunteers. Open from 8:45 am to 9:45 pm Mon – Fri and 9:00 am to 12:00 pm Sat, the Library offers a range of resources to students to aid in research and support for the curriculum, develop life-long learning abilities and foster a love of reading.

                    Both the libraries would have a huge collection of books as well as e-Books. We have a vast collection of fiction and non-fiction books and also a wide variety of books on art and craft, travel, drama, literature, philosophy, sports, technology, mathematics and science.

                    A wide range of encyclopediae and reference books meet the recreational and curriculum needs of students as well as teachers. Any donations to these collections would be appreciated. The Teacher Resource section of the library will be regularly upgraded and updated. It will have a wide range of regularly updated CBSE, IGCSE, ICSE and IB books.

                    The library also has a range of DVDs, which can be borrowed by parents and teachers. The library subscribes to a range of magazines and newspapers, current issues are for use only within the library, but all users may borrow back issues for one week.

                    We will bring visiting authors, poets and illustrators from all over the country to speak to our students and a range of activities would be conducted all through the year to bring love for reading among students.

                    Both our libraries are equipped with computers and Wi-Fi access, so that all forms of research can be accomplished.</p>

                    Nahar International School welcomes you to the School’s healthy, hearty self-service cafeteria. Meals will be freshly prepared on site, using high quality ingredients. We plan to serve a wide range of healthy, tasty meals from around the world, giving the cafeteria a truly international flavour. All our students from Grade 1 and upwards are invited to use the cafeteria. The cafeteria would also be available for our staff members. Class teachers will have lunch with students to ensure that students eat adequate portions and practice etiquette during mealtimes.

                    Our menu will have significant choices and would be released a month in advance so everyone will know what to expect. Monthly menus can be downloaded from the website. Parents will be welcome to contact us to try out the menu.

                    Meals would be purely vegetarian and children will be permitted to eat a packed lunch in the cafeteria.

                    The cafeteria will be open at break times for healthy snacks over two separate sittings at lunch: for Primary Wing and Secondary Wing students.

                    NIS cafeteria is not a profit-making activity. Prices will be kept to an absolute minimum and are set to match running costs. Our cafeteria is designed to serve our students' needs.

                    The NIS cafeteria will use a cashless meal service, whereby parents set up an account with the school and students will need to only swipe their cards to make a purchase.

                    The system will make payments as easy as possible, allowing parents to view, pay and top up directly online. In addition, all account purchases would be viewable online, and parents will also be able make account restrictions, such as setting a daily spend limit or blocking particular food items, and notify School about food allergies online.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">To empower our students to be better prepared to deal with ongoing technological changes in society and the workplace, IT is integral to the teaching-learning interaction. We use a diverse set of tools to communicate, create, disseminate, store, and manage information. The IT curriculum focuses on a broad exposure to technologies aimed at enhancing the creativity, imagination, problem-solving and higher-order thinking of the learners.

                    Teachers are digitally literate and regularly trained to use cloud-based tools and applications. Laptops, digitized classrooms, high-speed internet connectivity, and security measures ensure that teaching, learning, assessment, and administration ensure seamlessly.
